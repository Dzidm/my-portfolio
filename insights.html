    <p>
      When someone asks, “Who are you?” it’s tempting to start listing titles, achievements, and roles. 
      But at my core, I am much more than these labels. I am a curious soul, constantly evolving and 
      driven by a deep desire to learn, create, and connect.
    </p>

    <h2>HOW IT STARTED</h2>
    <p>
      My journey began in Ghana, a land of rich culture and vibrant heritage. Growing up, I was captivated 
      by the intricate interplay of language, art. This fascination led me to pursue a Bachelor’s 
      degree in French and Psychology, blending my passion for understanding people with my love for language and expression. 
      Today, I channel that passion into crafting digital experiences as a Frontend Web Developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my story doesn’t end there. Beyond the screens and lines of code, I am an innovator who believes 
      in the transformative power of ideas. I’m a designer who sees beauty in simplicity, and a problem solver 
      who thrives on challenges. Whether I’m creating a sleek interface or writing lines of poetry, my mission 
      is always to inspire and make a difference.
    </p>

    <h2>ON THE OTHER SIDE</h2>
    <p>
      Outside work, you’ll often find me exploring new cuisines, diving into a good book, or penning my thoughts 
      on the intersection of culture and technology. I am a believer in lifelong learning, and every experience—whether big or small—is a step toward becoming the best version of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is just a glimpse of who I am. A seeker. A storyteller. A creator. I invite you to join me on this journey, 
      where every line of code and every word written is a reflection of my commitment to growth and innovation.
    </p>
